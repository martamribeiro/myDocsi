# Accessibility
This is an updated version of the Goldydocs sample site that uses the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) Hugo theme. This version has been designed to be completely accessible and usable, operating in accordance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ( WCAG v1.0). If you find anything on this site that does not comply with the standards — regarding accessibility or validation — please contact the [developer](https://github.com/martamribeiro).
